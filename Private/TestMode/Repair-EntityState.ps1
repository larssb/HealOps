<#
.DESCRIPTION
    Basically a wrapper function used to invoke a specific *.Repairs.ps1 file, companying a *.Tests.ps1 file.
.INPUTS
    [StringTestFilePath. Representing the path to the *.Tests.ps1 file that was executed and by which a failed state was identified.
    [Hashtable]TestData. Holds data from executing the test/tests in the *.Tests.ps1 file.
.OUTPUTS
    [Boolean] relative to the result of the attempt to repair the state of "X" IT service/Entity
.NOTES
    <none>
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> $ResultOfRepair = Repair-EntityState -TestFilePath $TestsFile.FullName -TestData $testResult.testdata -ErrorAction Stop @commonParms
    Calls Repair-EntityState. The *.Repairs.ps1 file will be identified from the $TestsFile.FullName input and the TestData in the $TestResult.TestData will
    potentially be used by the *.Repairs.ps1 file, in order to repair a failed state of 'x' IT system/component.
.PARAMETER TestFilePath
    The full path to a *.Tests.ps1 file. From this file the Repairs file will be determined.
.PARAMETER TestData
    Data from an executed test.
