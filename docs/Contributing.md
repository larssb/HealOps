# Contributing guidelines

## Contributing to HealOps and HealOps packages

....more to come.

## License and rights

A _CLA_ (Contributor License Agreement) is what I in the future would like to formulate. However, as of now, there is none. But. What you contribute to HealOps is out of free will and you will not be compensated in any way. Other than get the joy in helping out, learning new cool tech. and being a part of the journey in making HealOps a rock solid monitoring, repairing and stats framework.

Thank you :-D.
