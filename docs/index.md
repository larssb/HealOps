# Welcome.

This is the home of the documentation on HealOps.

__HealOps__ the state monitoring and broken state repairing framework. Use it for all your operation validation needs. Automatically monitor and repair the state of IT systems and their components. You just write Pester tests to monitor the state of an IT system or component and regular PowerShell scripts, for repairing a broken state of a tested IT system or component.

I hope you find the documentation useful and less boring to read than the manual to your new vacuum cleaner.

_N.B._ If you see a spelling mistake, something that needs to clarify or have other comments or ideas to submit. Please, feel free to add an issue on the projects GitHub issue [page](https://github.com/larssb/HealOps/issues).
