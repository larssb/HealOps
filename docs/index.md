# Welcome

This is the home of the documentation on HealOps. You should be able to find everything you need to get started with HealOps. And as your project grows you can use this site as your helping hand.

I hope you find the documentation useful and less boring to read than the manual to your new vacuum cleaner.

- Info on HealOps itself, go here > [What is HealOps?](./HealOps-What.md)
- On HealOpsPackages, start here > [What is a HealOpsPackage?](./HealOpsPackages-What.md)

Welcome, glad to have you :-D.

_N.B._ If you see a spelling mistake, something that needs to clarify or have other comments or ideas to submit. Please, feel free to add an issue on the projects GitHub issue [page](https://github.com/larssb/HealOps/issues).
