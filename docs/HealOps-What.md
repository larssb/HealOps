# What is HealOps?

__HealOps__ is a state monitoring and broken state repairing framework. Use it for all your operation validation needs. Automatically monitor and repair the state of IT systems and their components. You just write Pester tests to monitor the state of an IT system or component and regular PowerShell scripts, for repairing a broken state of a tested IT system or component. A HealOpsPackage is the container for your repair, test and stats scripts.
