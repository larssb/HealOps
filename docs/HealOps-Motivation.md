# The motivation

I [Lars Bengtsson](https://github.com/larssb), started developing HealOps in early 2017. Stemming from the thought that it had to be possible to make life as a DevOps Engineer and as a member of the on-call team at work easier.

__By:__
- Improving the info received when getting alerted on an on-call watch.
- Even better, developing a system that tries healing 'x' IT component and if that succeeds I can continue my sleep unknowingly of the mishap.
        - Although it will be possible to see that this happened, as the issue is logged.
- Having the system automatically contact the person on on-call duty, instead of having manual labour doing this. Because, having manual labor doing this.
        - The person/persons alerting an on-call duty person, often does not have the info and even sometimes the necessary skillset required to manage what 'x' component being in a bad state really means for 'x' system.
        - Has so far been my experience that this slows the mean time to response.
        - The number of incorrect call-ups is too high.
- Automatizing the monitoring, healing and alerting of IT services and its components.
- By making it possible to query the health of IT services and its components over time and thereby making available, to a higher degree of likeliness, the support of informed decisions that are based on data.
- Present and visualize data via dashboard systems.
- Packaging the code needed to monitor and healing 'x' IT service and its components into clearly compartmentalized entities. That makes it possible to:
        - Deploy those easily.
        - Modularize these packages, which then makes it easier to re-use them for different IT service monitoring and healing situations.
- By providing stats on components and IT systems. Making it possible to consider pro-active measures for the future and knowing where the most gain is available.
- Freeing up resources for improving and designing better products.
