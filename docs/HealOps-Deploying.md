# Deploying HealOps

## Preparation

When deploying HealOps to a node you will need to deploy:
* The specific HealOps package/s needed in order to monitor and repair the IT system or component of interest.
* HealOps itself.

So figure out which HealOps packages you need, if they aren't available, you can develop them yourself. Read more on the [Developing a HealOpsPackage](./HealOpsPackages-GettingStarted.md).
