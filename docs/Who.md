# The people behind

Currently HealOps is a solo project. By me, [Lars Bengtsson](https://github.com/larssb). I work as a DevOps Engineer in Denmark. I'm looking for more hands on deck as HealOps is a rather big and complex project. So if you are looking for a challenge. Feel the idea of HealOps and love coding. Then please do not hesitate to contribute. Read more on [contributing](./Contributing.md).
