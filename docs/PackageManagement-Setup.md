# Getting ready for managing packets

HealOps has successfully been tried with `ProGet` and `Sonatype Nexus Repository OSS`. Most thorougly with `ProGet`. Both products come in a free version and works perfectly well. I have hands-on experience with `ProGet` in production and I have no complaints.

Go to the [ProGet homepage](https://inedo.com/proget) if that is your choice.
Or to [the Sonatype homepage](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss) if you landed on that as your package management system.

## Configure the product

* Setup a nuget type feed. Refer to the documentation of the package management product you chose.
